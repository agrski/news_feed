# News Feed

## Purpose

Writing this app should help to improve my knowledge of a few different things:
* Integrating backend and frontend services
* Kotlin coroutines
* Creating UIs (with TypeScript/Angular(?))
* RSS/feed APIs


## Features

This app should, in the long-run, support the following:
* Allow the user to add (and delete) multiple news feeds from which to read.
* Categorise news into, for example, world news, sports, and finance.
* Offer multiple tabs/expandable sections in the UI for different categories.
* Provide updates in near-realtime, i.e. order of minutes rather than hours.
